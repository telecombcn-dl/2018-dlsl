## Registration

Registration procedure depends on the student profile:

* **Master students at ETSETB and FIB:** Follow the regular schedule from your academic office. 
* **Mobility students:** If your host institution has signed an agreement with UPC ETSETB Telecom BCN school, you can request a mobility from your host institution and sign up for the course under the same conditions as ETSETB students.
* **Students at UPC but not in ETSETB:** Contact the your academic office and request being allowed to take this course. If accepted, contact [ETSETB academic office](http://www.etsetb.upc.edu/ca/els-serveis/secretaria-oberta) and request more details.
* **Non UPC nor mobility students:** You must apply for being accepted in the course and cover the 100% cost of the ECTS credits, without the support of the public funds. This corresponds to 143,08 € per ECTS credit (Summer 2016). If you are interested in this option, please contact the [ETSETB Telecom BCN academic office](http://www.etsetb.upc.edu/ca/els-serveis/secretaria-oberta), with an e-mail to secretaria@etsetb.upc.edu or calling at 93 405 4174 / 93 401 6772 / 93 401 5966 or 93 401 6750 in the morning (Monday to Thursday from 11 to 14 and Fridays from 11 to 13) or noons (Wednesdays and Thursdays from 16 to 17h).
